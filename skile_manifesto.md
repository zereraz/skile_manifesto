# The Skile Manifesto
### Future of skile : 
>A company that helps people learn anything, a company that has the deepest understanding of how people learn and can back it up with its huge database. An advanced state of the art machine learning base code that comes very close to how humans learn. We will make teaching a lucrative thing on the internet. We will regularly release research papers on human learning. So basically skile has to become
the world learning expert.

## Philosophy
- We aim at promoting learning around the wrold.
- We want every good quality to meet its audience.
- We want to create an community that helps each other learn.
- We want to help people learn fast and not waste time finding good resources.
- There should be free resources for every form of learning, if there is none we will pay a little to anyone that creates any learning material for it.
- Our learning paths i.e sequential ordering of learning material for optimal output will be one of our most important features. 
- The site will be basically run by people, they will add content and help each other. They will remove/report spam. Very similar to reddit.

## Core Features of the website
- Anyone can submit a learning link.
- He/she has the right to create categories.
- Category creation by anyone
- Category creating will be an extremely rigerous process as the person who will create it will be expected to manage the category. We may have a ratings system on the admins and moderators.
- Moderators will be chosen by the people or the admin.
- This rating system/polling system could use pollit.
- Anyone can create a learning path, that is according to them the best way to learn a skill.
- People will rate content, paths.
- A good comment system, probably a new way to comment or similar to reddit.
- We want things to happen after a discussion as we give people a lot of power we want to allow them to change things.
- Reporting links,learning paths, individuals etc need to be a nice system.

## Tough questions to answer
* Will we allow users to submit learning material?
* We may have a paid version where we will get premium content before release/on request. Should we have premium version?
* How to prevent spams?
* How do we deal with people managing content? Like admin's and moderators.
* more to come
